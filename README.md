# Syndesis UI

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/syndesisio/syndesis-ui.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/syndesisio/syndesis-ui) [![Commitizen friendly](https://img.shields.io/badge/commitizen-friendly-brightgreen.svg)](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/)

The front end application or UI for Syndesis - a flexible, customizable, cloud-hosted platform that provides core integration capabilities as a service. It leverages open source technologies like Apache Camel, OpenShift and Kubernetes to provide a rock-solid user experience.

For the middle tier API that this client communicates with, please see the [syndesis-rest](https://github.com/syndesisio/syndesis-rest) repo.

## Quick Start
You can follow these steps if it's your first time setting up Syndesis, or if you want a fresh local installation to replace an existing one.

1. Make sure you have installed [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version >= 6.x.x and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) version >= 0.18.1.

2. Get a developer deployment of Syndesis running in a Minishift environment as described in the
[Syndesis Quickstart](https://syndesis.io/quickstart/). Most are specific to your environment, so follow the links below for a quick setup:

- [Install a hypervisor for Minishift](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/minishift/getting-started/installing.html#install-prerequisites). For macOS, we recommend using the Docker xhyve plugin [here](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/minishift/getting-started/setting-up-driver-plugin.html#xhyve-driver-install), which can be installed using Homebrew.
- [Install Minishift](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/minishift/getting-started/installing.html#installing-instructions). For macOS, we recommend you use the Homebrew method.

3. Get a local developer UI with hot reloading, using the Syndesis backend running on Minishift:

```bash
# Clone our repo:
$ git clone https://github.com/syndesisio/syndesis-ui.git

# Change directory to Syndesis:
$ cd syndesis-ui

# Start up Minishift
$ minishift start

# Make sure Minishift is running:
$ minishift status

# Which should look like:
Minishift:  Running
Profile:    minishift
OpenShift:  Running (openshift v3.6.0+c4dd4cf)
DiskUsage:  11% of 17.9G

# Log into OpenShift with developer account
# Password: whatever you like
$ oc login -u developer

# Set environment variables to point to Minishift resources:
$ eval $(minishift oc-env)
$ eval $(minishift docker-env)

# For a fresh install of Syndesis:
$ ./scripts/syndesis-install --clean --pull

# Install the dependencies:
$ yarn install

# Start the UI server:
$ yarn start:minishift
```

The `yarn start:minishift` command works when it can properly detect your local development machine's IP address.  A proxy server inside the minishift deployment will use that IP address to connect back to the development server being run by the yarn command.  If detection of the IP is failing for you, then set the `SYNDESIS_DEV_LOCAL_IP` env variable to your local machine's IP address before running the yarn `yarn start:minishift` command.

Open the Syndesis UI in your browser from the command line by running:

```bash
# To connect with Syndesis backend you don't have to use http://localhost:4200 url.
# The url has a structure similar to http://syndesis-ui-default.192.168.42.205.nip.io

# You can try to obtain it directly from Minishift configuration with one of the following commands.

# on macOS
$ open https://$(oc get routes syndesis --template "{{.spec.host}}")

# on linux
$ xdg-open https://$(oc get routes syndesis --template "{{.spec.host}}")

# on windows
$ start https://$(oc get routes syndesis --template "{{.spec.host}}")
```

A smoke test to verify you are ready to work is to add any content at the beginning of `src/app/app.component.html` and verify you see the modification in the main page of the application.

If you are having issues with Minishift, you can also use `https://0.0.0.0:4200/` to access the UI for quick development, but it will not use Minishift resources, so the app will not work properly.

In a separate tab, you might want to run unit tests and lint checks as you code. See below for more information on how to do that.

### Day-to-Day Workflow

```bash
# Start up Minishift
$ minishift start

# Log into OpenShift
# Username: developer
# Password: whatever you like
$ oc login

# Set environment variables to point to Minishift resources:
$ eval $(minishift oc-env)
$ eval $(minishift docker-env)

# Start the UI server:
$ yarn start:minishift
```

Follow the instructions above for opening the Syndesis UI in your browser.

At the end of the day you might want to stop Minishift:
`$ minishift stop`

### File Structure

We use the component approach in our starter. This is the new standard for developing Angular apps and a great way to ensure maintainable code by encapsulation of our behavior logic. A component is basically a self contained app, usually in a single file or a folder with each concern as a file: style, template, specs, and component class.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

What you need to run this app:

* `node` (`brew install node` for OS X users)
* `yarn` (see [https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install))
* `angular-cli` (optional, but useful for development. see [here](https://cli.angular.io/))
* Ensure you're running the latest versions Node `v6.x.x`+ and Yarn

You do *not* need to install Angular CLI globally, but we recommend it if you'd like to use the [convenient commands](https://cli.angular.io/reference.pdf) it provides, or any of the `ng` commands we reference below.

### Committing changes

The repo is commitizen friendly, after making some changes:

`yarn commit`

to commit them. `yarn commit` is the same as running `git cz` in this case. So, you can use all the git commit options, 
for example: `yarn commit -am 'Blah blah blah''`.

Don't forget to add your files to staging first with `git add -A`. This is a `git commit` tool, not a total `git` replacement.

### Documentation

We use [Compodoc](https://compodoc.github.io/website/) for documentation, or [here](https://compodoc.github.io/website/guides/comments.html) to see how to format comments. Files get generated automatically in the `/documentation` directory. Read the documentation [here](https://compodoc.github.io/website/guides/getting-started.html) to see how to properly document features. You can automatically generate and run docs using Yarn:

`yarn compodoc`

Or manually with `compodoc -s`, or `compodoc` if you want it to simply generate the files in the default `/documentation` directory and run it with an HTTP server.

#### Production
*Requires having `angular-cli` installed globally.*

`ng serve --prod -aot`

For a list of common commands, see [here](/docs/commands.md).

## Testing

### Watch and Run Unit Tests

`ng test` or `yarn test`

### Run Tests without Watch

`ng test --watch=false`

For a list of common commands, see [here](/docs/commands.md).

### Linting

To run the linter: `yarn lint`

## Configuring

Configuration files live in `/config`. Configuration files are currently available for Webpack, Karma, and Protractor.

## Contributing

Pull requests are always welcome. Please read through our [Contribution](https://syndesis.io/community/contributing/) guidelines for submitting improvements.

New feature development should generally follow [these guidelines](https://syndesis.io/community/engineering_guidelines/).

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

You can read our FAQ, located in our `/docs` directory, [here](/docs/faq.md).

## Data Mapper

To update the data mapper, change the commit SHA in package.json to pick up the desired code revision, then run `yarn install`.  Verify that the projects still builds by running `yarn start:prod` and adjust the code as necessary based on the data mapper example usage in the [README](https://github.com/atlasmap/atlasmap-ui).

When updating the SHA you should also run `yarn copy:assets` to bring over any assets the data mapper component needs, this tasks copies them all to `src/assets/dm`
